Columns re_test_preds, re_test_std, re_train_preds, and re_train_std include the testing predictions and standard deviations and training predictions and standard deviations for each molecule in the training validation set.\
r1_learninig_curves.csv: A csv file containing a statistical summary of each step used for producing the learning curves. To get these results the ml_model function in [r1.ipynb](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Ibrahim-Mamrstein/Spectroscopic-constants-from-atomic-properties/blob/675a7ef80706594b614d08ff2983706efb1f9aab/r1/r1.ipynb) was run several times with different testing set sizes, each was run for 500 MC-CV splits. \
