# Data gathering

In this project spectroscopic constants of diatomic molecules have been gathered from various published books, papers, and online accessible databases (e.g, [The Diatomic Molecular Spectroscopy Database](https://rios.mp.fhi.mpg.de/index.php) and [NIST Chemistry WebBook](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/))
 ### Homonuclear molecules:
 Most homonuclear molecules' spectroscopic data have been gathered from Huber and Herzberg's book [[1]](#1). The references used to gather spectroscopic information of diatomic molecules gathered from sources are cited in the references column in the g.csv and g-test-2.csv files.
