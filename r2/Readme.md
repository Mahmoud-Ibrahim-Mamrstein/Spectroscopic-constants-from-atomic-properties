# Model r2

A GPR model with a Matern 3/2 kernel and with groups and periods of the constituent atoms and the reduced mass of the molecule as features. We explicitly express the model's prior mean functions as linear functions in the groups and periods of the diatomic molecules' constituent atoms.
$$m_{r1-r2} = \beta_0^{r1-r2}+\beta_1^{r1-r2}(p_1+p_2) + \beta_2^{r1-r2}(g_1+g_2)$$
where  $\beta_k^{r1-r2}$, $k \in \{0,1,2\}$ are the linear coefficients of  $m_{r1-r2}$.
